    <p>Polar bears are the largest land carnivores, native to the Arctic region. With their thick white fur and a layer of fat, they are well adapted to survive the freezing temperatures and icy waters. These powerful swimmers rely on sea ice to hunt seals, their primary food source. However, climate change and melting ice threaten their habitat, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival.
